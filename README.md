# support
Please note -- this repo represents the building blocks that were used on the Zendesk support site, but because of the Zendesk templating language and deploy process it is not a one-to-one replication of what is live. The main exception to this is the `app.css` file that is in sync (and should be kept this way) with the the css file powering the help center.

## development
This site is built on a Gulp workflow, specifically using the [Blendid system](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/tree/blendid).
